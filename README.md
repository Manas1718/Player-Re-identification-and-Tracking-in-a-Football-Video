# Player-Re-identification-and-Tracking-in-a-Football-Video
This project demonstrates real-time player detection, tracking, and re-identification in a 15-second football video. It uses a custom-trained YOLO object detection model and DeepSORT tracker to ensure that players who go out of frame and reappear are consistently assigned the same identity.
